    "# Targeting with Partial Incentives\n",
    "\n",
    "Diffusion of influence in social networks is a widely studied phenomenon in contexts that vary from viral marketing to\n",
    "the broader field of social sciences.\n",
    "\n",
    "A problem related to this phenomenon, known as the Target Set Selection, is the one to find the minimum set of nodes to\n",
    "influence in order to cause a cascade in the network, i.e. the minimum number of individuals to influence directly in\n",
    "order to have the whole network influenced indirectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "A variant of this problem is the one in which individuals can be given relatively small incentives to make a decision\n",
    "rather than the full effort needed to actually influence them. This is the Partial Incentives variant and here the goal\n",
    "is to find incentives assignment that minimizes the total cost of influencing the whole network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of the above problems have already been studied. This project is an attempt to apply and compare two algorithms\n",
    "known for solving the variant with partial incentives of the problem in a nondeterministic network using the\n",
    "deferred decision principle, which considers edges of the network to be active or inactive based on some probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project structure\n",
    "\n",
    "A few utility modules have been created in [sources](/src) folder to easily interact with the data. Pre-processing\n",
    "tasks, that consist of binding thresholds to nodes and edges as well as randomly remove some of the latter by coin\n",
    "tossing, have been modeled in the [preprocessing](/src/preprocessing) module.\n",
